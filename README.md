# Marine Energy Collegiate Competition (MECC)

This respository provides examples of running a Sphere and the RM3 in the Boundary Element solvers [NEMOH](https://github.com/LHEEA/Nemoh) and [Capytaine](https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine).

Capytaine:
In the Capytaine folder there are two examples of how to set-up and run a Capytaine simulation and the RM3 and Sphere examples. The two cases contain input meshes (.dat), .py files to call Capytaine easily, and a .nc output file that can be compared to, and a WEC-Sim BEMIO script that can read Capytaine output data. These should be used as examples of how to set-up Capytaine, not to actually use. Proper mesh convergence of the cases is not guaranteed, they may be more expensive than necessary. See the Capytaine cookbook for an example of a simple mesh convergence study. See the README file in the Capytaine folder for more details.

Nemoh:
