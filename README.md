# Marine Energy Collegiate Competition (MECC)

This respository provides examples of running a Sphere and the RM3 in the Boundary Element Method codes [Capytaine](https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine) and [NEMOH](https://github.com/LHEEA/Nemoh).

# Capytaine
In the Capytaine folder there are two examples of how to set-up and run a Capytaine simulation and the RM3 and Sphere examples. The two cases contain input meshes (.dat), .py files to call Capytaine easily, and a .nc output file that can be compared to, and a WEC-Sim BEMIO script that can read Capytaine output data. These should be used as examples of how to set-up Capytaine, not to actually use. Proper mesh convergence of the cases is not guaranteed, they may be more expensive than necessary. See the Capytaine cookbook for an example of a simple mesh convergence study. See the README file in the Capytaine folder for more details.

# Nemoh
Please refer to the Nemoh `README.md` file for:
- Instructions for how to download Nemoh (v113 and v115)
- An overview of the Nemoh project folder structure
- Instructions for how to run Nemoh (v113 and v115) and post-process the results

The folder contains two full working example cases - complete with results - which should help to get you started using Nemoh!
